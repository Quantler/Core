You can set any user specific configurations in this folder, these settings will be merged and override the default configuration.

This folder is ignored in git, so you can store anything you want.

How can I add my own configuration?
Add a file with the exact same name as the normal configuration file and edit only the parts you want to change.
The default config is loaded first, any changes you make in your version will override the default config.
